# [Donaction - Enterprise](http://donaction.com.br/)

Donaction Enterprise is a Donaction's project aimed at the entrepreneurs who are interested in Social Marketing for their businesses. The website's purpose is to introduce the product in a friendly and functional way and, hopefully, seal the partnership.

## The Site

As we're dealing with a prototype, only so much energy will be spent in functionality. That being said, some parts of the system will be "frankensteined" from Donaction's original page.

## For Nerds

We were told to use Java in any aspect of the system, so we decided to use in the back-end along with the SQL Server, powered by Azure, to store the user's data. That's why the folder structure is divided beetween front and back-end.

## Web.Config

In the near future the site will be hosted on Azure and some problems in the IIS configuration will show up, to solve those the "web.config" file is necessary and will be commited in time.
